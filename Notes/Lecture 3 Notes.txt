Objectives:
Testing and debuging programs and program modules to meet specifications and standards
Implement programs that use data types and demonstrate an understanding of numbering
Incorporate both basic and advanced control structures appropriately into algorithms

Intro to Loops
While Loops
For Loops
Running Loops


While Loop Structure:
While(Boolean):
# As long as this expression is true or false whatever follows will execute

Print(...)

Some code that makes the loop stop (We can use a break statement or just set the variable being checked to false if it is set to true initally)

 while(i < number):
        print(i + 1) # We are not changing the value of index.
        # Statement that makes boolean expression false
        i += 1

num = 3


FOR Loops

For val in range(1, num + 1) run the loop, that is the loop will run until the preset value is reached.

Print(val)
