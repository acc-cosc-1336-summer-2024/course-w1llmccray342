Functions:

A function helps us organize code and break it down into modules. The computer does not care, the coding structure is
for eligibility.

Easier to Test,
Easier to Maintain,
and Easier to Reuse

Two types of functions:
- A function that returns a values
- A function that does not return a value, but returns void. Sometimes known as Fruitless functions.

Functions are modular.

- A function is like a black box, it takes a parameter (variable) as input and runs it against some code. 
As a result it may or may not show an output.

Value return functions are generally more used.

Functions can have multiple variables within the function themselves.

Local variables are those that exist only in their scope
Global variables are variables that exist in the scope of the entire project.

Functions are used to help organize and reutilize our code.
