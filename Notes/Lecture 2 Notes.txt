Constants are variables that cannot or should not be changed. 

Python does not have builtin constants, PYthon recommends that we name our 
constants as caps only. 

constants are read only in other languages but not in PYTHON so we use
a specific syntax to determine what is and isn't a named constant. 


Boolean logic - 
True/False

George Boole (1815-1864)
- Self-taught in mathematics
- Helped support his family at 16
- Opened his own school at 20
- 1841 - Published papers on differential equations
- 1847 - Published "The Mathematical Analysis of Logic, being an Essay towards
a Calculus of Deductive Reasoning argued that logic could be applied to math."
- 1847-1854 - Does the work on Boolean Logic
- 1849 - Professor of Mathematics, Queen's College
- 1854 - Published Laws of Thought
       - This theory eventually led to the evolution of the modern age.

 Boolean Logic - 
 The idea that something could be on or something could be off or something could
 be true or something could be false.

 Truth tables  and logic operators.

 AND
 OR
 NOT
 NAND
 NOR

 AND
 IF X True and Y True then the Result is True
 If X True and Y False then the Result is False
 IF X False and Y True then Result is False
 IF X False and Y False then Result is False

 OR
 IF X True OR Y True then Result is True
 IF X True or Y False then Result is True
 IF X False or Y False then Result is True
 IF X False or Y False then Result is False

 Boolean expressions are variables that evaluate to true or false.
AND Result = TRUE and TRUE and TRUE and TRUE AND False

or
Result = False OR False OR False OR False OR False...n or TRUE
- True

NOT True AND NOT True

Order of operations is NOT AND OR 

Determine if a Number is between 1 & 10

1 > 0  and 1 < 11

1 >= 1 and 1 <= 10 

--
0 <= 1 or 0 <= 10
T or T = t

5 <= 1 OR 5 <= 10
F         T  = t

5 <= 1 or 5 >= 10 
False       False


0 <= 1 OR 0 >= 10
False       False

11 <= 1 or 11 >= 10
False           True
